# Soho

Soho is a minimalist two-column [hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme based on [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) inspired by the success of [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex).

It was created by [Alexandre Vicenzi](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/soho). This is the repo, where I changed some aspects of it, to better suit my needs.
